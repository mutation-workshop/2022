topic: >
 Mutation for Compiler Testing
abstract: >
 Mutation testing has been studied for more than 40 years. Its application spans from test criterion to fault localization, program repair, and empirical studies. Besides these application domains, mutation is also used in compiler testing since inputs of a compiler are programs. In the talk, the speaker will introduce their work on mutation-based compiler debugging, demonstrating how mutation aids test program generation with the purpose of compiler debugging. Finally, the speaker will give some discussion on more compiler testing tasks with the usage of mutation and conclude some characteristics of mutation usage in compiler testing.
